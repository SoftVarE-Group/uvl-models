# Data base for Real-world variability models in UVL
In this repository, we provide a large variety of publicliy available industrial feature models. Each model is provided in the Universal Variability Language format (UVL). 


We always welcome new proposals for feature models that should be included in our dataset. You can just leave us a message or open a pull request to merge your models.
